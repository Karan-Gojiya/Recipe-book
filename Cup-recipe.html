        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <!-- <p> NOTE:This recipe makes two 1-pound balls of pizza dough, which is enough <br>for two large pizzas or four personal-sized 10-inch pizzas<br><br>
            Instant or rapid-rise yeast is actually a different strain of yeast from the usual<br>granulated yeast. It is designed to be mixed directly into the flour. If you canâ€™t<br>find it, use the equivalent amount of active dry yeast and proof it in warm<br>water according to the package directions.<br><br>Leftover dough can be placed in a zip-top freezer bag and frozen for up to<br>three months. Allow the dough to thaw in the fridge overnight before using.</p> -->
            <p>4 cups (500g) all-purpose flour
                1 1/2 teaspoons (slightly less than a full packet) instant yeast<br>
                1 1/2 teaspoons salt<br>
                1 1/2 cups (350g) lukewarm water<br>
                1 teaspoon olive oil</p><br>
